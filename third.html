				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>Hi, I am a sophmore at Binghamton University pursuing a B.S. in computer science. I have always had a passion for computers, building my first one in sixth grade. I enjoy coding in Java, Python and C and I am interested in machine learning, computer vision and algorithms. I seek to learn existing methodologies and discover new and innovative solutions to complex problems! </p>

				<p>Along with my love for computers, I also have a passion for cars, skiing, hiking, fishing and anything outdoors!  </p>

				<h2>Experience</h2>
				<a id="rescon"></a>
				<p>.</p>
				<h3>Residential Computing Consultant</h3>
				<p>As a residential computing consultant (ResCon) I work with students in dorms to resolve any technical issues they have. Issues may include: hardware or software issues, network issues, printer issues, etc. As a ResCon, I am also responsible for managing the IT help desk at the library once a week- this includes fixing printers, assisting students with printers, assisting students with any technology issues/ questions. </p>
				<p>.</p>
				<h3>Peer Mentor (First Year Research Immersion)</h3>
				<p>As a peer mentor, I lead a team of five students in developing a research proposal that addresses a real-world problem. It is my responsibility to guide the team in weekly meetings, teach new research techniques, assist with grading of assignments, assist the professor at weekly lectures.</p>
				<p>.</p>
				<h3>Researcher (First Year Research Immersion)</h3>
				<p>My team and I have been researching machine learning and human robot interaction in Mahjong. Our research is detailed in a 10 page research report and a poster that we present at a poster session. The goal of our research is to develop a robotic arm capable of playing Mahjong. We developed a convolutional neural network for image detection using the keras, tensorflow, numpy and glob python libraries. We also used coppelia sim to simulate our robotic arm in a virtual environment. We used answer set programming to implement logic. </p>
				<p>.</p>
				<h3>Senior Waterfront Lifeguard</h3>
				<p>As a senior waterfront lifeguard I was responsible for supervising lifeguards, ensuring shift rotations are timely and efficient, train new lifeguards, train all lifeguards at weekly training sessions. I also developed a scheduling program that creates a biweekly schedule for 23 employees at the Thomas P. Morahan Waterfront Park.</p>
